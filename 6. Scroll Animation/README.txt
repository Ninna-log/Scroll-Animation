<h1>SCROLL ANIMATION</h1>

This is a very useful project.
We can find this type of scroll animation in websites where we
start scrolling in parts of the site and the images or sections
start to come in.

So, to start there's a few content blocks in the beginning
of the page, and if you start scrolling down, the next one block 
comes in from the left, then go down some more, and the next one
comes from the right, and so on. 
I used CSS transitions to have these blocks come in smoothly and
Javascript to basically tell where the trigger point is for the 
next box to come.
